This is not ready for distribution. This is just a code dump for now.




This lib offers two methods to retrieve the ISO 8601 week number and year from a timestamp and the other way around.

This functionality is pretty straight forward in the middle of a year. Around the beginning and end of one,
there are some special cases you need to catch. This is what it done for you.

iso_8601_week_and_year_for_time(time)         => week, year
time_from_iso_8601_week_and_year(week, year)  => time
